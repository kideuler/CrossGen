A purely 2D implementation of Cross-fields along with block decomposition

TODO:
- [X] Implement polyvectors to obtain crossfields.
- [X] Robustly detect and classify singularities.
- [X] Cut Mesh for MIQ.
- [X] Link Comisol for Greedy mixed integer solver.
- [X] construct UV integer grid map.
- [X] Some basic Visualization.
- [ ] Reformat Code to better separate different pieces. (Mesh, Polyvectors, IGM)
